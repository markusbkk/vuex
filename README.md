Vuex is a [state management pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_management) + library originally created for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. 

This **fork** makes Vuex available for use in non-Vue applications such as React, ReactJS, React Native. When it comes to state management, Vuex comes to being one of the most perfect, and predictable state management library based on concepts (and terminology).

> This fork is **not** offcially endorsed nor related to work done by Vue team. It is simply a [non-intrusive modification to Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/pull/2149) to use Vuex outside of Vue ecosystem. Any credits for Vuex go entirely to the awesome Vue team.
